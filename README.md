## Description

This module install OpenSIPS Control Panel, a PHP Web Portal for provisioning OpenSIPS SIP server.

## Setup

This module OpenSIPS CP Web Portal, but not OpenSIPS sip proxy.

This module writes to the mysql database so be careful if installing on top of an existent OpenSIPS installation. You should consider backup your database first.


### Beginning with opensipscp

To install OpenSIPS CP with the default module options, simply include the class in your manifest.

```
include opensipscp
```

## Usage

Include usage examples for common use cases in the **Usage** section. Show your users how to use your module to solve problems, and be sure to include code examples. Include three to five examples of the most important or common tasks a user can accomplish with your module. Show users how to accomplish more complex tasks that involve different types, classes, and functions working in tandem.

## Reference

This section is deprecated. Instead, add reference information to your code as Puppet Strings comments, and then use Strings to generate a REFERENCE.md in your module. For details on how to add code comments and generate documentation with Strings, see the Puppet Strings [documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/puppet_strings.html) and [style guide](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/puppet_strings_style.html)

If you aren't ready to use Strings yet, manually create a REFERENCE.md in the root of your module directory and list out each of your module's classes, defined types, facts, functions, Puppet tasks, task plans, and resource types and providers, along with the parameters for each.

For each element (class, defined type, function, and so on), list:

  * The data type, if applicable.
  * A description of what the element does.
  * Valid values, if the data type doesn't make it obvious.
  * Default value, if any.

For example:

```
### `pet::cat`

#### Parameters

##### `meow`

Enables vocalization in your cat. Valid options: 'string'.

Default: 'medium-loud'.
```

## Limitations

In the Limitations section, list any incompatibilities, known issues, or other warnings.

## Development

In the Development section, tell other users the ground rules for contributing to your project and how they should submit their work.
